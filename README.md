# Final-project-Behavioral-Economics-

final project - Omri Savir

The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model capable of estimating the proportion of individuals choosing a given option in binary choice problems. The challenge stemmed from the fact that, while participants made their choices based on the actual numerical payoff distributions, I had access only to the verbal descriptions of these distributions, without the precise numerical values and distributions. To address this, I implemented a hybrid approach that integrates Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with principles from Behavioral Economics. This combined methodology allowed for the extraction of meaningful patterns from textual descriptions while accounting for cognitive biases and decision-making heuristics observed in human behaviour.
As we discussed in class and as demonstrated in the paper Predicting Human Decisions with Behavioral Theories and Machine Learning, combining ML with behavioral rules leads to significantly better predictive performance than using either approach alone. Human decision-making is influenced not only by rational models but also by cognitive biases, framing effects, and loss aversion, factors that ML models alone may overlook without explicit behavioral considerations.
